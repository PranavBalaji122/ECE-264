    /*
    Below is the description of this function from the readme. You should think about how to implement this logic.

    This function uses recursion to find the lexicographically smallest path 
    from the START cell to the END cell, and print the path as a sequence of moves. 
    Only moves to the right (East) and down (South) are allowed. 
    Since we are travelling from the upper leftmost square to the lower rightmost 
    square and we can only move south or east, any valid path will have the 
    same number of south and east moves regardless of obstacles in the grid. Thus, 
    the lexicographical smallest path is the valid path where we always move east when 
    we can, and move south only when we have to. Thus, using recursion, you need to find 
    the path where you move east until you cannot move east anymore (because of an obstacle 
    or because you reached the boudanries of your grid), then move south just enoough until 
    you can move east again (if you can), until you reach the END square. 
    */

    /* Hint :
    You should first check if you can move east, then check if you can move south.
    If a path in invalid because of an obstacle, you should cancel this path.
    Cancelling the path is equivalent to cancelling the last move you made, 
    or cancelling the last 2 moves, or 3... etc, as many as you need. This is called backtracking.
    */

    // useful for`lexicographically_smallest_path` to know when no path is found)
